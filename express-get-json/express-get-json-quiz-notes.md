## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is an API endpoint?
A: an API endpoint is a specific location within an API that accepts requests and sends back responses. It's a way for different systems and applications to communicate with each other, by sending and receiving information and instructions via the endpoint.

http://localhost:8080/api/grades

"api/grades" is the API endpoint.

Note: It is customary to use a prefix for backend APIs similar to the /api prefix used in this exercise. The purpose for doing this is to make it easier to determine which endpoints are intended for which types of request: Endpoints with the prefix will always be called with an XHR-style request, while those without may be navigated to in the browser. With this information, Express code can more easily optimize each style of API for its intended use.

- What is the appropriate `Content-Type` header for HTTP messages that contain JSON in their bodies?
A: Content-Type: application/json
